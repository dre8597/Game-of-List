# Game-of-List
a game of living and dying cells
This a really more of a simulations of what happens when certain cells are places next to each other.
If the cells has two or three neighbors it lives to see the next generation if it has less than two than it dies from being lonely
If more than three then it dies it being overcrowded.
If the cells was never alive but has exactly three living cells touching it the that cell comes to live in the next gen
